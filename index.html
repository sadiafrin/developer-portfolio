    <h3>Hey! My name is Afrin.
        I am a front End Web
        developer </h3>
        <p>I have been <span>working </span>as a front-end developer since 2021. I’ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web design in college, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to  logical side to code.

         <p>I specialize in creating sites for individuals and small businesses. You shouldn’t have to settle for cheap solutions or generic templates. I provide custom designs at afforable prices. Frequently your website is the first impression your customers will get, so make sure it’s a good one. Since my time is split between a few different things, I’m not able to take on every project I’d like to, but I'm always looking for fun work. Take a look at my portfolio below, if you think I’d be a good match send me an email.</p>
